Partly AI generated code for calculating the radius of two identical circles with the help of a wire of known thickness and a ruler.
The application helps determining the radius of of a couple of profiled long skating blades.

Mittalangan paksuus = wire thickness in mm

Mitattu v√§li = measured distance between the positions where the wire stops in the gap between the skate blades
